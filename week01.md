* I was introduced to a project and tools;
* I was given CERN computer account with an access to lxplus and other computing nodes;
* I tried out simple Spark, Hadoop and CMSSpark commands;
* I tried using pandas and matplotlib python libraries for data manipulation and plotting;
* I wrote a simple program which collects PhEDEx data for a specific date, pulls parts of it to local machine, aggregates it to a single file, prints out some information about it and plots the results.
